                    Biometrics is a system that uses your physical characteristics like your 
                    fingerprint, iris or face to do a task, usually unlocking your mobile device. 
                    This system requires three things, a sensor to detect the characteristic of 
                    your body part, a computer to read and store the information, and software 
                    that analyzes the characteristic and will perform a comparison between the 
                    information from the sensor and computer everytime the biometric system is 
                    activated. If both the information from the storage and sensor are the same,
                    the device will be unlocked.

                            These systems work faster than inputting passwords manually which makes it

                    <p class="text-center">
                        Just like biometrics, automated cars need three main things 
                        to make it work, a sensor to detect the cars surroundings, a 
                        computer to store the information, and software to process the 
                        information and control the car. The sensors use the white lines 
                        on the side of the road to map out a path for the car to travel, 
                        the software tells the car that it can only drive within the 
                        white lines, which means that this technology will not work 
                        outside of conventional roads unless specially programmed for 
                        a specific route. The sensors also detect things such as traffic 
                        lights, stop signs, and other cars. The software identifies 
                        these things and tell the car to act accordingly to what it sees.

                            IoT is the technology which allows a mini ecosystem of computers such as
                            a home automation system to communicate with each other. Itâ€™s how the 
                            amazon Alexa can control the lights in your room or the fridge from 
                            across the house. This technology is becoming more mainstream and is 
                            going to further improve with the introduction of 5G connectivity, 
                            which will make communications between each device almost instant 
                            providing a much more seamless experience for the user. This system 
                            usually requires a hub or controller device, a connection to a network 
                            or cloud, software, computer and user interface. Systems like this 
                            allow you to control your home from wherever and can allow you to 
                            monitor things inside your home.
