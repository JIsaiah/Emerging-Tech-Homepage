                    Biometrics is a system that uses your physical characteristics like your 
                    fingerprint, iris or face to do a task, usually unlocking your mobile device. 
                    This system requires three things, a sensor to detect the characteristic, a 
                    computer to read and store the information, and software that analyzes the 
                    characteristic and will perform a comparison between the information from the 
                    sensor and computer. If both of the information are the same, the device will 
                    be unlocked.

                            These systems work faster than inputting passwords manually which makes it
                            more convenient.

                    <p class="text-center">
                        Just like biometrics, automated cars need three main things to make it 
                        work, a sensor to detect the cars surroundings, a computer to store the 
                        information, and software to process the information and control the car. 
                        The sensors use the white lines on the side of the road to map out a path 
                        for the car to travel, the software tells the car that it can only drive 
                        within the white lines, which means that this technology will not work 
                        outside of conventional roads unless specially programmed for a specific 
                        route. The sensors also detect things such as traffic lights, stop signs, 
                        and other cars. The software identifies these things and tell the car to 
                        act accordingly to what it sees.

                                Better traffic control due to cars being able to communicate with each
                                other and coordinate movement.

                                Less accidents as cars are always alert and have 360 degree vision.
