        Biometrics is a system that uses your physical characteristics like your
        fingerprint, iris or face to do a task, usually unlocking your mobile
        device. This system requires three things, a sensor to detect the
        characteristic of your body part, a computer to read and store the
        information, and software that analyzes the characteristic and will
        perform a comparison between the information from the sensor and
        computer everytime the biometric system is activated. If both the
        information from the storage and sensor are the same, the device will be
        unlocked.

          It is nearly impossible to forget or lose the security key which is
          always attached to you. Your body parts are special to you and hard to
          copy.

          These systems work faster than inputting passwords manually which
          makes it more convenient.

    <div id="cons" class="tabcontent">
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you the part of you that is registered to the system is damaged or
          had its appearance altered, the system will not recognize it.
        </li>
