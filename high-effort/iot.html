        IoT is the technology which allows a mini ecosystem of computers such as
        a home automation system to communicate with each other. It’s how the
        amazon Alexa can control the lights in your room or the fridge from
        across the house. This technology is becoming more mainstream and is
        going to further improve with the introduction of 5G connectivity, which
        will make communications between each device almost instant providing a
        much more seamless experience for the user. This system usually requires
        a hub or controller device, a connection to a network or cloud,
        software, computer and user interface. Systems like this allow you to
        control your home from wherever and can allow you to monitor things
        inside your home.

          Security risks are high and having someone else gain access to your
          home can let them control your home and spy on you through cameras and
          microphones.

          The products can be expensive, especially for the whole ecosystem.
