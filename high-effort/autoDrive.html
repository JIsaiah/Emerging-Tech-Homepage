        Just like biometrics, automated cars need three main things to make it
        work, a sensor to detect the cars surroundings, a computer to store the
        information, and software to process the information and control the
        car. The sensors use the white lines on the side of the road to map out
        a path for the car to travel, the software tells the car that it can
        only drive within the white lines, which means that this technology will
        not work outside of conventional roads unless specially programmed for a
        specific route. The sensors also detect things such as traffic lights,
        stop signs, and other cars. The software identifies these things and
        tell the car to act accordingly to what it sees.

    <div id="pros" class="tabcontent">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Better traffic control due to cars being able to communicate with each
          other and coordinate movement.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Less accidents as cars are always alert and have 360 degree vision.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="cons" class="tabcontent">
      <ul>
        <li>
          A human is always needed in the drivers seat to take control just in
          case the system fails.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Weather may block the sensors, preventing them from working properly.
        </li>
      </ul>
